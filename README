PuertoRandom.py

Selects a random set of buildings for the board game Puerto Rico!
The script will not generate setups that contain the following combinations:
	* Hacienda / Forest House
	* Office / Trading Post
	* Factory / Specialty Factory
	* Villa / Jeweler

To generate a setup that includes buildings from the base game and the first expansion, run:
	PuertoRandom.py
	
The rules for the second expansion are to play with everything, but you have the option to include the buildings from the second expansion in a random setup if you prefer.
	
To specify which expansions to include, pass them as parameters:
	ONLY FIRST EXPANSION
		PuertoRandom.py 1
	ONLY SECOND EXPANSION
		PuertoRandom.py 2
	BOTH EXPANSIONS
		PuertoRandom.py 1 2
